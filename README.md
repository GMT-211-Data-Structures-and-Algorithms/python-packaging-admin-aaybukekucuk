# shortestpath21967646

This Python package implements **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** to find the shortest path in a directed graph.  
It is designed to be simple, testable, and ready for deployment on TestPyPI.

---

## Features

- Calculates shortest paths using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm  
- Takes graph input as a dictionary  
- Includes logging support  
- Tested with `pytest`  
- Includes GitHub Actions CI/CD  
- Packaged and published to TestPyPI  
- Sphinx documentation support  
- AI-assisted code development (with ChatGPT)

---

## Installation

To install the package from TestPyPI, run the following command:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ shortestpath21967646
```

---

## Usage Example

You can import and use the `dijkstra` function like this:

```python
from sp211_21967646_98.sp211_21967646_98 import dijkstra

graph = {
    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],
    'B': [('C', 2), ('D', 5)],
    'C': [('D', 1)],
    'D': []
}

distances = dijkstra(graph, 'A')
print(distances)
```

Expected output:

```
{'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 3, 'D': 4}
```

## Continuous Integration / Delivery

This project uses GitHub Actions for:

- Automatically running `pytest` after every push  
- Ensuring that the package builds correctly  
- Verifying the installation and packaging process

CI configuration can be found in `.github/workflows/python-test.yml`.

---

## AI Usage

I used **ChatGPT** to:

- Write and debug the `dijkstra` function  
- Build the correct `setup.py`, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt`  
- Configure GitHub Actions  
- Prepare the project structure  
- Fix test errors and improve packaging  
- Generate full Sphinx documentation

AI support helped me write better, faster, and more organized code.
